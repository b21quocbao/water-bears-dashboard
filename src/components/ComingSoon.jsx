              Friedrich, the chemist in charge of research on water bears, noted
              that when placed in a certain envionment, water bears generate a
              high level of a yellow energy, called $DNA. Each WaterBear can
              generate 5 $DNA / day.

                It seems that this energy can be used to reproduce 2 waterBears
                together! After several unsuccessful attempts, our team
                succeeded in creating a WaterBears embryo using a stable
                quantity of $DNA.
                <span className="text-left">
                  With 300 $DNA, we are able to create a tube with a WaterBears
                  egg on the inside.

                We've done it, it's great! incredible! We succeeded in giving
                birth to the first babyWaterBear ! Their genome is unknown and
                does not resemble any existing living being, it's really
                fascinating. However, we have noticed that they are limited,
                only 6,666 Babys able to live.

                Something strange happened in the labo, a thud and a flash of
                lightning made the walls vibrate ! The chemist in charge of
                WaterBears research, Friedrich, was found lifeless. It seems
                that a never-before-seen viscous material is responsible for
                this.

                This substance is really strange, it doesn't come from the earth
                that's for sure. Despite Friedrich's death, we'll continue to
                carry out our research - it was his life's work, and we owe him
                a debt of gratitude.

                Our first research on the sludge has provided us with some
                information.... this substance is not stable at all and is
                extremely difficult to synthesize. However, we have managed to
                stabilize it in a safe state but in very small quantities....
                (1000). It also seems that once sludge has been manipulated, it
                vaporizes forever and can never be used again. <br></br>
              </p>
              <p>
                But his physical properties are incredible, and will make it
                possible to do things never seen before....

                We've experimented the sludge on several subjects, and all have
                proved unsuccessful... However, in the last one, we noticed that
                before dying, subject number 34 had a degeneration of his
                DNA...which transformed him into a second state for a few
                seconds. Very very interesting... We need to do more research
                and accelerate them, sludge is very difficult to maintain in
                this state, we have very little time !! <br></br>
